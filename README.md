# Asc_or_Desc_Order_of_Input_Array
Ascending or Descending

Instead of hard coding the array content your new requirement is to read the number from a file formatted as the following: 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5

5, 4, 3, 2, 1

10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60

etc., etc.


Note that each line could be a different number of numbers.  Your output should indicate whether the numbers on each line are descending or ascending.
